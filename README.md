# i18n support 

Thanks to IA code generation (Sourcegraph Cody), I created in a few minutes a github action to translate my resume in 2 languages.

Idea is to have a single file `resume.i18n.json` having all translations node using the following format:

```json
    {
  "name": "Scora",
  "releaseDate": "2024-09-03",
  "en_summary": "Tennis scoreboard for watch on Google Android WearOS",
  "fr_summary": "Tableau de score tennis pour montre Google Android WearOS",
  "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.geoking.tennis.scoreboard.wear"
}
```

# TODO

- A github.io page to display resume in different languages
